## Project scope

Our project aims to help customers simplify and always be up-to-date with their workflows.

A workflow can be comprised of the following:
- 2 or more involved parties/accounts
- 2 or more steps that conclude the workflow
- Steps may include but are not limited to:
	- Filling out or creating a form or document
	- Approving or signing a form or document

To accomplish this, we intend to implement the following features and functionalities:
- Dashboard with all currently running workflows and their status and goal
- Archive with completed workflows
- Tool to create a custom workflow and add the involved parties via account or link
- Preset workflows which are standard and often used or needed
- Verified accounts for official documents acquired through workflows

For the creation of this project we intend to use the following tools:
- Springboot (Kotlin)
- Postgres
- Vue (Typescript)
- Primevue

The project does not aim to include the following features:
- In-built messaging between accounts (contact info may be added to accounts)
- Publicizing workflows
- Surveys or similar open ended forms
